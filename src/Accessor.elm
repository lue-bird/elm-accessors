{-| Relations are interfaces to document the relation between two data
structures. For convenience, we'll call the containing structure `super`, and
the contained structure `sub`. What a `Relation` claims is that a `super` is
referencing a `sub` in some way.

Relations are the building blocks of accessors. An accessor is a function that
expects a `Relation` and builds a new relation with it. Accessors are
composable, which means you can build a chain of relations to manipulate nested
structures without handling the packing and the unpacking.

{-| A `Relation structure focus focusView` describes how to interact with a
`focus` when given a `structure`.

Sometimes, `view` can't return a `focus`
For instance, `List focus` may not actually contain 1 `focus`.
Therefore, `focusView` can be a simple wrapper which, in that example, will be `List focus`

        }


{-| Every accessor defined using `Relation`s is a traversal of some kind.

  - [`Lens`](#Lens): 1:1
      - e.g. the selected element in a `SelectList`
  - [`Prism`](#Prism): 1:Maybe
      - e.g. the value of one of many variants
  - 1:n
      - e.g. each array element

-}
type alias Traversal structure focus focusView focusFocus focusFocusView =
    Relation focus focusFocus focusFocusView
    -> Relation structure focusFocus focusView


{-| [`Traversal`](#Traversal) over a single value: 1:1. Examples

  - [`Tuple.Accessor.first`](Tuple#first)
  - [`SelectList.Accessor.selected`](SelectList-Accessor#selected)
  - record .field value

Intuitively, a "Lens" type could look like

    type alias Lens structure focus =
        { view : structure -> focus
        , replace : focus -> (structure -> structure)
        }

Unfortunately, we then need `composeLens`, `composeIso`, `composePrism` functions.

Defining "Lens" in terms of `Relation`s:

    Relation focus focusFocus focusFocusView
    -> Relation structure focusFocus focusFocusView

we're able to make use of `<<`
to [`view`](#view)/[`map`](#map) a nested structure.

Technical note: This is an approximation of [Van Laarhoven encoded lenses](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-05-05-existential-optics/).

equality for complex structures. Therefore, using lazy `map` will
not prevent `Html.lazy` from doing its work.

  - A function `(focus -> focus)`
  - A data `structure`

and it returns the data `structure`, with the focusView field changed by applying
the function to the existing value.
The structure is changed only if the new field is different from the old one.
